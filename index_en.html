                    <p class="intro__text">According to VTSIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36%
                    plan to spend
                    their holidays in their native country. Like,
                    what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south,
                    the dense forests of the Sayan
                    Mountains and
                    the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions in your account,
                    a passport and
                    many hours of flights. For example, Vera Bashmakova is a brave young mother who took
                    three children in her arms,
                    sat
                    them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some
                    interesting places
                    worthy of your vacation.</p>

                        First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees,
                        mountain rivers and lakes. What if
                        you will open the windows in the car, you will be able to get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places —
                        the mountain
                        air.</p>

                        <p class="places__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer.
                        This way you will see all the diversity of the local flora and fauna.
                        Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And
                        the famous manuls are also inhabitants

                        <p class="places__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
                        for skioring competitions. This is a sport where a skier
                        ties himself
                        to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019
                        A
                        world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile Festival.</p>

                        have never known
                        an axe because of impassable swamps. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living being who
                        saw the sun before
                        Ivan the Terrible saw it.
                        There is no trail for a hundred kilometers in the virgin forest. And on rare paths, trees
                        a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
